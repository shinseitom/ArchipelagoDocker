# ArchipelagoDocker
Simple and dirty dockerizing of the Archipelago video game multiworld randomizer.  
Personally, I gave it its own ip, instead of doing any port mapping.  
Currently using archipelago v0.4.6, built using default github docker build and publish action.  
Made it as small as I could with my meagre docker-fu, but still decently chunky.
